# Understanding Union and Intersection Types in TypeScript

TypeScript provides powerful tools to compose types ‚Äî two of the most common are **union** (`|`) and **intersection** (`&`) types. Let‚Äôs explore what they do and how to use them with real-world examples.

---

## Union Types (`|`)

A **union type** allows a variable to be **one of several types**. This is great when a value might come in different forms.

### Example: Handling API Response

```ts
type Success = {
  status: "success";
  data: string;
};

type Error = {
  status: "error";
  message: string;
};

type ApiResponse = Success | Error;

function handleResponse(res: ApiResponse) {
  if (res.status === "success") {
    console.log("Data:", res.data);
  } else {
    console.error(" Error:", res.message);
  }
}
```

## Intersection Types (`&`)

An **intersection type** in TypeScript lets you combine multiple types into a single one. The resulting type has **all the properties** of the types being combined.

### What It Means

Think of it as saying:  
**‚ÄúThis value must satisfy both Type A and Type B.‚Äù**

---

### Example: Admin User

```ts
type User = {
  name: string;
  email: string;
};

type Admin = {
  role: "admin";
  permissions: string[];
};

// Intersection type: must include all properties from both User and Admin
type AdminUser = User & Admin;

const admin: AdminUser = {
  name: "Alice",
  email: "alice@example.com",
  role: "admin",
  permissions: ["read", "write", "delete"],
};
```

### üõ† When to Use

Use intersection types when:

You want to combine features or traits.

An object must fulfill multiple roles or categories.

You‚Äôre extending multiple reusable types.

# What is Type Inference in TypeScript? And Why It Matters

TypeScript is well known for its static typing ‚Äî but did you know you don‚Äôt always have to explicitly write types? That‚Äôs where **type inference** comes in.

---

## What is Type Inference?

**Type inference** is the process where TypeScript automatically determines the type of a variable, parameter, or return value **based on its initial value or usage** ‚Äî without you explicitly specifying it.

### Example:

```ts
let name = "Alice"; // TypeScript infers: string
let count = 42; // TypeScript infers: number

function greet(user: string) {
  return `Hello, ${user}`;
}

const message = greet("Bob"); // TypeScript infers: string
```

### Why is Type Inference Helpful?

- **Less Code, Same Safety**  
  You write fewer type annotations but still get the benefits of type checking.

- **Improved Readability**  
  Cleaner and more concise code makes it easier to maintain and understand.

- **Smart Autocompletion**  
  TypeScript knows the types, so editors like VSCode can offer intelligent suggestions and documentation.

- **Faster Development**  
  TypeScript catches mistakes early ‚Äî even when types aren‚Äôt explicitly written.

**TypeScript‚Äôs type inference makes your code smart, safe, and clean ‚Äî helping you enjoy the benefits of types without the overhead of writing them everywhere.**
